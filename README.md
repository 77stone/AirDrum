ConsoleMotionRecorder
=====================

--

## Platforms

This should work under Windows, Linux and Mac, though only Windows was tested yet.
The only platform dependent code is the *getChar* function used in main().

## Requirements

This tool requires a python 2.x installation and a Leap Motion device (www.leapmotion.com) with installed Leap app v0.7.3 or higher.
Alongside with the source file *ConsoleMotionRecorder.py*, the Leap python API (again SDK v0.7.3 or higher) should be provided in the same directory:

* *Leap.py*
* *_LeapPython.pyd*
* *Leap.dll*
